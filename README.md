# Cybervyatka

[Cybervyatka](https://cybervyatka.firebaseapp.com/) is a local eSports tournament for Vyatka State University students.
To manage all the matches, teams and play off grid I developed that web application.
So tournament admins could manage all the matches but players could check the plays schedule,
their team information and other useful stuff.

## Tech stack

- Vue 2 as application framework
- Yandex.Metrica for analytics
- Material Design components for minimalistic design
- Firebase Firestore as database, Firebase Hosting as hosting, Firebase Storage as (you won't believe it) static files storage

## Project setup

To be honest, I couldn't build that project so far because it's too old but you can try to fix all that issues if you need it.
You can use this [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
Old build steps:

1. Install all the dependencies
```
npm install
```
2. Run the app locally
```
npm run serve
```
3. Build release artifacts
```
npm run build
```
